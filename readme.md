# Image Tile

### Description

This program allows you to make collages of images in a grid format, with
varying size borders. It allows you to group these sub image spaces (tiles)
however you like, and thus gives you a lot of control.

### Testing

To run the tests, just navigate to the `test.html` page in the `tests`
directory.

### To Package

Optional:

* Download the latest `normal` nw.js release here: <http://nwjs.io/downloads/>

* Unzip it, rename it to `nwjs-base` and put it in the root directory of the
project.

Run `ant build-nwjs` then `ant clean`.
